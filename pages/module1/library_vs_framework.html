    <h1>Library vs Framework</h1>
    <p>The key difference between a library and a framework lies in the control and structure they provide for your
        code:</p>

    <h2>Library</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can call upon to solve
            specific problems or perform specific tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> You are in control of the flow of the application. You call the library's
            functions when needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Example</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>jQuery (manipulate the DOM)</li>
                <li>Lodash (utility functions)</li>
                <li>Axios (HTTP requests)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Framework</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> A framework provides a structured way to build and organize your application. It
            typically includes tools, libraries, and conventions.</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> The framework is in control of the flow. You write parts of your application, and
            the framework calls your code as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Example</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>React (if treated as a framework for component-based UI)</li>
                <li>Angular (complete frontend framework)</li>
                <li>Vue.js (progressive framework)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In summary, a <strong>library</strong> is like a tool you use as needed, while a <strong>framework</strong> is more like a blueprint or scaffold
        that dictates the overall structure and flow of your application.</p>
